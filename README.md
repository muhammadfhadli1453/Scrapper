# Scrapper
This is a scrapper machine for Jobstreet. How to use:
  1. Extract geckodriver-v0.25.0-win64.zip
  2. Set your environment variable into the directory of extracted Geckodriver
  3. Start running the script
  
 Things you should know about this code:
  1. In the .ipynb file, you can configure how many page you want to scrap
  2. My first plan was to store all of the scrapped data into MySQL, but I still got some error
